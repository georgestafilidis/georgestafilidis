### Hi, I'm George

I’m actively learning and contributing to open source projects. Passionate about Linux and open-source software, I’m eager to collaborate, grow, and create meaningful impact through code.

### Current Project

I’m building a Distro Chooser — a website that helps Windows users find the right Linux distribution to switch to, making the transition smooth and accessible.

### Goals

* Build my first open-source project
